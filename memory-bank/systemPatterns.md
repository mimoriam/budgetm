2025-09-17 07:28:0 - Initial project analysis completed. The project follows a standard Flutter architecture with Provider for state management and SharedPreferences for local data storage. The UI is organized with a bottom navigation bar and a floating action button menu that changes based on the current screen. The project uses a consistent color scheme defined in AppColors and typography defined in AppTheme.
[2025-09-17 10:34:00] - Implemented consistent loading state pattern for authentication buttons across all authentication screens. Pattern includes:
  1. Boolean _isLoading state variable to track operation status
  2. Setting _isLoading = true at start of async operations
  3. Setting _isLoading = false in finally block to ensure cleanup
  4. Conditional button rendering with CircularProgressIndicator during loading
  5. Disabling buttons during loading to prevent multiple submissions
[2025-09-17 16:52:00] - [Implemented authentication state caching in AuthGate to prevent unnecessary CircularProgressIndicator during navigation]
[2025-09-18 1:18:00] - Fixed "table 'accounts' has more than one primary key" error by removing redundant PRIMARY KEY declaration in account_model.dart and updating app_database.dart schema version
