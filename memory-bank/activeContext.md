2025-09-17 07:28:0 - Initial project analysis completed. Understanding the project structure, architecture, and codebase to prepare for any development tasks.
[2025-09-17 10:21:00] - Fixed onboarding screen repeatedly popping up issue. Made SharedPreferences access consistent across the project by changing all instances from SharedPreferencesAsync to SharedPreferences.getInstance() in main.dart, onboarding_screen.dart, and theme_provider.dart. This ensures immediate synchronization of SharedPreferences values.
[2025-09-17 10:34:00] - Completed implementation of circular progress indicators for authentication buttons. All authentication screens (login, signup, forgot password) now have loading state management to prevent multiple submissions and provide visual feedback during authentication operations.
[2025-09-17 16:52:00] - [Fixed circular indicator issue during navigation by optimizing AuthGate authentication checks]
[2025-09-18 09:09:27] - Added sqlite3_flutter_libs to dependencies in pubspec.yaml for Drift database integration
[2025-09-18 1:18:00] - Fixed "table 'accounts' has more than one primary key" error by removing redundant PRIMARY KEY declaration in account_model.dart and updating app_database.dart schema version
[2025-09-18 16:38:00] - Working on fixing the home screen refresh issue after adding an income transaction. Analyzing the current implementation in add_transaction_screen.dart and home.dart to implement a proper refresh mechanism.
[2025-09-18 16:43:00] - Completed implementation of automatic refresh of home screen after adding income/expense transactions. Created HomeScreenProvider to manage refresh state, modified MainScreen to await results from AddTransactionScreen and trigger home screen refresh when transactions are successfully added, and updated HomeScreen to listen to the provider and refresh data when needed.
[2025-09-18 16:45:00] - Fixed critical "Error saving transaction: type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'DateTime' in type cast" error. Implemented default DateTime value (DateTime.now()) for date field when "more" options are not expanded in add_transaction_screen.dart, ensuring transactions can be saved without explicitly setting date/time.
[2025-09-18 12:45:00] - Implemented navigation from HomeScreen to ExpenseDetailScreen when a transaction is tapped. Added a helper function to convert database Transaction model to UI Transaction model for proper data passing between screens.
[2025-09-18 19:05:00] - Added top padding to the appbar in home.dart to separate it from the status bar. Used MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top to dynamically calculate the status bar height and added it as top padding to the appbar container.
[2025-09-18 19:21:0] - Fixed issue with home screen refresh loading data for current month instead of selected month. Modified _refreshData() method in home.dart to use month-specific data loading methods with _months[_selectedMonthIndex] parameter instead of generic methods that always loaded current month data.
