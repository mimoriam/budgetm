2025-09-17 07:28:0 - Initial project analysis completed. Understanding the project structure, architecture, and codebase to prepare for any development tasks.
[2025-09-17 10:21:00] - Fixed onboarding screen repeatedly popping up issue. Made SharedPreferences access consistent across the project by changing all instances from SharedPreferencesAsync to SharedPreferences.getInstance() in main.dart, onboarding_screen.dart, and theme_provider.dart. This ensures immediate synchronization of SharedPreferences values.
[2025-09-17 10:34:00] - Completed implementation of circular progress indicators for authentication buttons. All authentication screens (login, signup, forgot password) now have loading state management to prevent multiple submissions and provide visual feedback during authentication operations.
