2025-09-17 07:28:0 - Initial project analysis completed. Reviewed project structure, key files, and architecture. Updated all memory bank files with initial context.
2025-09-17 09:50:41 - Implemented FirestoreService with saveUserData method
2025-09-17 09:57:44 - Verified Firebase packages in pubspec.yaml and ran flutter pub get
2025-09-17 09:58:22 - Completed Firebase authentication and Firestore integration. Created firebase_auth_service.dart with email/password authentication, Google Sign-In, and password reset functionality. Created firestore_service.dart with user data saving capabilities. Integrated these services into login_screen.dart, signup_screen.dart, and forgot_password_screen.dart. Updated AuthGate for authentication state handling and navigation. Confirmed all necessary Firebase packages are in pubspec.yaml.
2025-09-17 10:07:00 - Refactored AuthGate to implement detailed login/signup/onboarding/setup flow. Created helper functions to check onboarding status, theme selection status, and currency selection status. Modified AuthGate to handle all flows correctly including initial app launch, onboarding, authentication, first-time setup, incomplete setup, and logout scenarios.
    
2025-09-17 10:09:0 - Completed implementation of logout functionality in ProfileScreen. Added FirebaseAuthService import, instantiated the service, and implemented the signOut() method with proper navigation handling.
[2025-09-17 10:21:35] - Debugged and fixed the onboarding screen repeatedly popping up issue. Made SharedPreferences access consistent across the project by changing all instances from SharedPreferencesAsync to SharedPreferences.getInstance() in main.dart, onboarding_screen.dart, and theme_provider.dart. This ensures immediate synchronization of SharedPreferences values and resolves the onboarding loop issue.
[2025-09-17 10:34:00] - Completed implementation of circular progress indicators for authentication buttons in login, signup, and forgot password screens. All authentication operations now have proper loading state management.
2025-09-17 11:16:14 - Completed removal of CircularProgressIndicator from AuthGate during initial onboarding check.
[2025-09-17 11:18:0] - Enabled Firebase Authentication local persistence by adding FirebaseAuth.instance.setPersistence(Persistence.LOCAL) in main.dart. This ensures user authentication state is persisted across app restarts, improving user experience.
[2025-09-17 16:52:00] - [Completed optimization of AuthGate to eliminate unnecessary CircularProgressIndicator during navigation]
