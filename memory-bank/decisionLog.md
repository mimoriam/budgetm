2025-09-17 07:28:0 - Initial project analysis completed. No major architectural decisions required at this stage. The project structure is well-organized with clear separation of concerns between models, views, and view models. The use of Provider for state management and SharedPreferences for local storage is appropriate for this type of application.
2025-09-17 10:09:00 - Implemented logout functionality in ProfileScreen using FirebaseAuthService. Added import, instantiated service, and implemented signOut() method with proper navigation to AuthGate.
[2025-09-17 10:20:45] - Fixed onboarding screen repeatedly popping up issue. Made SharedPreferences access consistent across the project by changing all instances from SharedPreferencesAsync to SharedPreferences.getInstance() in main.dart, onboarding_screen.dart, and theme_provider.dart. This ensures immediate synchronization of SharedPreferences values.
[2025-09-17 10:34:00] - Added circular progress indicators to authentication buttons in login, signup, and forgot password screens. Implemented loading state management for all authentication operations to prevent multiple submissions and provide visual feedback to users.
2025-09-17 11:15:59 - Removed CircularProgressIndicator from AuthGate during initial onboarding check to avoid showing a loading indicator before the onboarding status is determined.
[2025-09-17 11:18:0] - Enabled Firebase Authentication local persistence by adding FirebaseAuth.instance.setPersistence(Persistence.LOCAL) in main.dart after Firebase initialization. This ensures user authentication state is persisted across app restarts.
2025-09-17 11:45:40 - Modified login screen to use separate loading states for Google Sign-In and Email/Password login, added mounted checks for setState calls, and implemented circular progress indicators for both authentication methods.
[2025-09-17 16:52:00] - [Optimized AuthGate to reduce unnecessary CircularProgressIndicator during navigation by implementing authentication state caching]
