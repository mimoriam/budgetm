# Budget Screen Revamp - Implementation Progress

## Completed Work

### 1. Project Cleanup and Preparation ‚úÖ
- **Removed** the "Add Budget" FAB button from [`lib/screens/dashboard/main_screen.dart`](lib/screens/dashboard/main_screen.dart:304)
- **Removed** the import for `add_budget_screen.dart` from main_screen.dart
- **Note**: The file `lib/screens/dashboard/navbar/budget/add_budget/add_budget_screen.dart` still needs to be manually deleted by the user

### 2. Data Model and Firestore Changes ‚úÖ
- **Updated** [`lib/models/budget.dart`](lib/models/budget.dart:3) with the new structure:
  - Removed: `name`, `totalAmount`, `currentAmount`, `endDate`
  - Added: `year`, `month`, `spentAmount`
  - Added helper method `generateId()` for creating composite budget IDs
  
- **Updated** [`lib/services/firestore_service.dart`](lib/services/firestore_service.dart:1):
  - Modified `createTransaction()` to automatically create/update monthly budgets for expense transactions
  - Modified `deleteTransaction()` to roll back budget amounts when expense transactions are deleted
  - Updated `streamBudgets()` to filter by year and month
  - Added new method `getBudgetsForMonth()` for fetching budgets for a specific month

## Remaining Work

### 3. UI Revamp for `budget_screen.dart` üîÑ
The following files have compilation errors due to the Budget model changes and need to be updated:

#### Files with Errors:
1. **[`lib/screens/dashboard/navbar/budget/budget_screen.dart`](lib/screens/dashboard/navbar/budget/budget_screen.dart:1)** - Primary file to revamp
2. **[`lib/screens/dashboard/navbar/home/transaction/add_transaction_screen.dart`](lib/screens/dashboard/navbar/home/transaction/add_transaction_screen.dart:1)** - Uses old Budget structure
3. **[`lib/screens/dashboard/navbar/budget/add_budget/add_budget_screen.dart`](lib/screens/dashboard/navbar/budget/add_budget/add_budget_screen.dart:1)** - Should be deleted

#### Required Changes for `budget_screen.dart`:
- Remove the "Active Budgets" and "Completed Budgets" sections
- Create a list view showing all expense categories with their monthly spending
- Update the pie chart logic:
  - By default: Show total spending across all categories for the current month
  - When a category is selected: Show spending breakdown for that specific category
- Add month/year selector for viewing different periods
- Fetch expense categories and combine them with budget data
- Display categories with no spending as $0

### 4. State Management Implementation ‚è≥
- Create a `BudgetProvider` class in [`lib/viewmodels/`](lib/viewmodels/) directory
- The provider should:
  - Hold the current selected month/year
  - Fetch and combine expense categories with budget data
  - Track the selected budget/category for pie chart display
  - Provide methods to change month/year
  - Handle real-time updates from Firestore

### 5. Testing and Validation ‚è≥
- Test automatic budget creation when expense transactions are created
- Test budget amount rollback when transactions are deleted
- Test UI updates and navigation
- Verify pie chart displays correctly for both aggregate and individual views
- Test month/year navigation

## Next Steps

1. **Fix compilation errors** in `add_transaction_screen.dart` by removing budget-related code (since budgets are now automatic)
2. **Completely rewrite** `budget_screen.dart` according to the new requirements
3. **Create** `BudgetProvider` for state management
4. **Test** the entire flow end-to-end

## Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The Budget model has fundamentally changed. Any code that references the old Budget structure needs to be updated or removed:
- No more `name`, `totalAmount`, `currentAmount`, or `endDate` fields
- Budgets are now automatically created per category per month
- Budget IDs are now composite keys: `{userId}_{categoryId}_{year}-{month}`
